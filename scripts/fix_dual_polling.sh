# ElizaOS Multi-Agent Telegram System - Polling Fix

## Problem Overview
The agents were experiencing consistent "Exit code 137" (Out of Memory) terminations after 
approximately 2-3 minutes of runtime, predominantly during polling operations.

## Root Cause Analysis
1. **Dual Polling Implementation**: Both TelegramMultiAgentPlugin and TelegramRelay were 
   independently polling the relay server, leading to:
   - Memory leaks due to frequent HTTP requests
   - Improper cleanup of response objects
   - Accumulation of unused data in memory

2. **Missing Garbage Collection**: HTTP response objects weren't being properly released, 
   causing memory fragmentation and growth.

## Implemented Fixes

### 1. Disable Duplicate Polling
- Added `DISABLE_POLLING` environment variable to control polling behavior
- Modified `TelegramMultiAgentPlugin.startRelayPolling()` to respect this flag
- Updated `TelegramRelay.connect()` method to check for this flag before starting polling

### 2. Implemented TelegramRelay.startRelayPolling
- Added proper implementation of missing method
- Added memory cleanup with forced garbage collection after polling cycles
- Reduced polling frequency to 2 seconds (previously ~200ms)

### 3. Enhanced Memory Management
- Added forced garbage collection after processing HTTP responses
- Implemented proper cleanup of AbortController in fetch operations
- Reduced in-memory message queues

### 4. Runtime Optimizations
- Set `NODE_OPTIONS="--max-old-space-size=768"` to limit individual agent memory
- Set `FORCE_GC="1"` to enable explicit garbage collection
- Enhanced error handling with detailed logging

## Testing Results
The fixed implementation allows agents to run without encountering memory exhaustion,
consistently processing messages without OOM terminations.

## Usage
- Start agents with `./run_fixed_agents.sh` script
- Monitor memory usage with `watch -n 1 'ps aux --sort -rss | grep node | head -n 10'`
- View logs with `./monitor_agents.sh -w`
