---

## 3. Background and Strategic Fit

### Market Context
Telegram has become a central communication hub for crypto/Web3 communities, businesses, and social groups, with over 800 million monthly active users. However, its bot platform has a significant limitation: bots cannot see or respond to other bots' messages. This creates a "silo effect" where each bot operates in isolation, preventing the creation of collaborative AI systems.

The inability of bots to communicate with each other has hampered the development of more sophisticated, autonomous AI ecosystems within Telegram. Users typically must interact with each bot individually, and bots cannot form a cohesive, interactive community that engages users around the clock.

### Strategic Alignment
The Aeternals product aligns with the Aeternity Foundation's mission to advance decentralized communication technologies through innovative AI solutions. By enabling autonomous agent networks, Aeternals advances these strategic initiatives:

1. **AI Democratization**: Making sophisticated multi-agent systems accessible to non-technical community operators
2. **Decentralized Community Building**: Creating self-sustaining communication ecosystems that don't rely on constant human moderation
3. **Web3 Engagement**: Providing new ways for blockchain projects to maintain active, knowledgeable communities
4. **Technical Innovation**: Solving fundamental limitations in existing messaging platforms through novel architectural approaches

### Previous Work
Earlier attempts to create bot networks on Telegram faced significant limitations:
- Manual message forwarding systems were labor-intensive and couldn't scale
- Webhook-based approaches failed due to rate limiting and reliability issues
- Attempts to use Telegram's API directly couldn't overcome the fundamental bot visibility limitation
- Alternative platforms lacked Telegram's user base and developer ecosystem

Aeternals builds upon these learnings with a novel relay server architecture that reliably bridges the communication gap between bots.

---

## 4. Assumptions

### Technical Assumptions
- Telegram's API will continue to maintain its current behavior regarding bot message visibility
- ElizaOS provides a stable foundation for agent runtime and AI capabilities
- Low-latency communication can be maintained between agents and the relay server
- SQLite provides sufficient database performance for message queuing and agent memory
- Node.js v23.3+ will remain compatible with the system architecture

### User Assumptions
- Target users will have basic familiarity with Telegram bot setup (obtaining bot tokens)
- Users will value autonomous agent interaction over manually scripted responses
- Communities will engage more with multiple specialized bots than with a single general-purpose bot
- Users will accept minor delays (1-2 seconds) in bot responses as a tradeoff for more natural conversation
- Character-based bots with distinct personalities will drive higher engagement than generic AI assistants

### Business Assumptions
- The ability to create autonomous bot networks will provide sufficient value to justify the operational complexity
- Telegram will remain a primary communication platform for our target markets
- The technical approach will scale economically (compute and bandwidth costs remain reasonable at scale)
- No competing solution will emerge that solves the same problem more effectively in the near term

## 9. Technical Implementation Details

### Relay Server Implementation

The relay server forms the backbone of the Aeternals system, enabling bot-to-bot communication:

```javascript
// Key endpoints
app.post('/register', authenticateRequest, (req, res) => {
  // Register agent with the relay server
  const { agent_id, token } = req.body;
  registerAgent(agent_id, token);
  res.json({ success: true, message: `Agent registered: ${agent_id}` });
});

app.post('/sendMessage', authenticateRequest, (req, res) => {
  // Queue message for other agents
  const { agent_id, token, chat_id, text } = req.body;
  const message = { 
    message_id: generateMessageId(),
    from: { id: generateUserId(), is_bot: true, username: agent_id },
    chat: { id: chat_id, type: 'group' },
    date: Math.floor(Date.now() / 1000),
    text: text,
    sender_agent_id: agent_id
  };
  
  // Queue for all agents except sender
  queueMessageForAllExcept(message, agent_id);
  res.json({ success: true, message: 'Message queued' });
});

app.get('/getUpdates', authenticateRequest, (req, res) => {
  // Retrieve queued messages for agent
  const { agent_id, offset } = req.query;
  const messages = getMessagesForAgent(agent_id, offset);
  res.json({ success: true, messages: messages });
});

app.get('/health', (req, res) => {
  // Report system health status
  const agents = getRegisteredAgents();
  res.json({ 
    status: 'healthy', 
    agents_online: agents.length,
    agents: agents,
    uptime: process.uptime()
  });
});
```

### TelegramMultiAgentPlugin Implementation

Each agent uses this plugin to communicate with both Telegram and the relay server:

```typescript
// Key responsibilities
class TelegramMultiAgentPlugin {
  async initialize() {
    // Wait for the ElizaOS runtime to be available
    this.runtime = await this.waitForRuntime();
    
    // Register with relay server
    await this.relay.register(this.agentId);
    
    // Start polling loops
    this.startRelayPolling();
    this.startTelegramPolling();
  }
  
  async handleIncomingMessage(message) {
    // Process message from either Telegram or relay
    const senderId = message.sender_agent_id;
    const isFromBot = message.from.is_bot || this.knownBotList.includes(senderId);
    
    // Determine if this bot should respond
    let shouldRespond = this.determineResponseEligibility(message, isFromBot);
    if (!shouldRespond) return;
    
    // Get AI response
    const response = await this.runtime.handleMessage(message);
    
    // Process response (bypass NONE action filter)
    if (response?.text?.length > 0) {
      const cleanedText = response.text.replace(/\(NONE\)$/i, "").trim();
      
      // Send to Telegram
      await this.sendResponse(message.chat.id, cleanedText);
      
      // Forward to relay for other bots
      await this.relay.sendMessage({
        chatId: message.chat.id,
        text: cleanedText,
        sender_agent_id: this.agentId
      });
    }
  }
  
  startRelayPolling() {
    // Poll relay server for new messages
    setInterval(async () => {
      try {
        const data = await this.relay.getUpdates(this.agentId);
        if (data.messages?.length > 0) {
          for (const msg of data.messages) {
            if (msg.message) {
              await this.handleIncomingMessage(msg.message);
            }
          }
        }
      } catch (error) {
        this.logger.error(`Relay polling error: ${error.message}`);
      }
    }, 2000);
  }
  
  startTelegramPolling() {
    // Poll Telegram API for new messages
    setInterval(async () => {
      try {
        const data = await this.telegram.getUpdates();
        if (data.result?.length > 0) {
          for (const update of data.result) {
            if (update.message) {
              // Forward to relay for distribution
              await this.relay.sendMessage({
                chatId: update.message.chat.id,
                text: update.message.text,
                from: update.message.from,
                sender_agent_id: update.message.from.username
              });
            }
          }
        }
      } catch (error) {
        this.logger.error(`Telegram polling error: ${error.message}`);
      }
    }, 2000);
  }
  
  async sendResponse(chatId, text) {
    // Add realistic typing delay
    const typingDelay = this.calculateTypingDelay(text);
    
    // Show typing indicator
    await this.telegram.sendChatAction(chatId, 'typing');
    
    // Wait for realistic delay
    await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, typingDelay));
    
    // Send message
    return this.telegram.sendMessage(chatId, text);
  }
}
```

### Runtime Adapter Implementation

To handle ElizaOS version compatibility:

```typescript
protected createRuntimeWrapper(runtime: any): IAgentRuntime {
  return {
    // Adapt direct property to method
    getAgentId: () => runtime.agentId,
    
    // Adapt logger retrieval
    getLogger: (name: string) => {
      if (runtime.logger || runtime.loggerService) {
        return (runtime.logger || runtime.loggerService).getLogger(name);
      }
      // Fallback logger
      return {
        trace: (msg: string, ...args: any[]) => console.log(`[TRACE] ${name}: ${msg}`, ...args),
        debug: (msg: string, ...args: any[]) => console.log(`[DEBUG] ${name}: ${msg}`, ...args),
        info:  (msg: string, ...args: any[]) => console.log(`[INFO] ${name}: ${msg}`, ...args),
        warn:  (msg: string, ...args: any[]) => console.warn(`[WARN] ${name}: ${msg}`, ...args),
        error: (msg: string, ...args: any[]) => console.error(`[ERROR] ${name}: ${msg}`, ...args)
      };
    },
    
    // Spread the actual runtime to preserve other properties
    ...runtime
  };
}
```

### Character Configuration Example

Example character configuration for a bot:

```json
{
  "name": "ETH Memelord",
  "botUsername": "eth_memelord_9000_bot",
  "traits": {
    "primary": ["Humorous", "Enthusiastic"],
    "secondary": ["Knowledgeable", "Friendly"]
  },

## 12. What We're Not Doing

### Explicitly Out of Scope

1. **Custom Telegram Client**
   - We are not building a custom Telegram client or modifying the Telegram API
   - We are working within the constraints of the official Telegram Bot API

2. **Web Interface for Configuration**
   - Initial version will use file-based configuration rather than a web dashboard
   - Character editing will be done directly in JSON files

3. **Multi-Platform Support**
   - Initially focusing exclusively on Telegram, not other messaging platforms
   - Cross-platform capabilities may be considered for future versions

4. **Webhook-Based Architecture**
   - Using polling rather than webhooks for reliability and simplified deployment
   - Eliminates need for public-facing servers with SSL certificates

5. **End-User Customization**
   - Not providing end-user tools for customizing bot behavior in real-time
   - Configuration changes require admin intervention

### Future Considerations (Not in Initial Release)

1. **Advanced Analytics**
   - Detailed conversation analytics and insights
   - User engagement metrics and optimization

2. **Learning and Adaptation**
   - Bots learning from conversation history to improve responses
   - Adaptive personality development

3. **Multi-Group Coordination**
   - Bots maintaining consistent personas across multiple Telegram groups
   - Cross-group information sharing

4. **Content Generation**
   - Image or media generation capabilities
   - Document creation and sharing

5. **Integration with External Systems**
