Two parties open a state channel by locking funds in a smart contract\n2. They can then exchange value and information off-chain\n3. Only the final state is settled on-chain when the channel is closed\n\nThis makes microtransactions practical and enables high-frequency trading scenarios. Would you like to know more about specific state channel applications?"
