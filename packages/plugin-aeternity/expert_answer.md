üì© Refined Message for SDK Experts
Subject: Accessing encodeBase58Check in @aeternity/aepp-sdk@14.0.0 with ESM

Hello,

Following up on the prior discussion regarding generateHDWallet from @aeternity/hd-wallet, we now need to convert the raw private key buffer it returns into a sk_... format string compatible with MemoryAccount.

In previous SDK versions, this could be done using encodeBase58Check from internal SDK utilities. However, under @aeternity/aepp-sdk@14.0.0, we‚Äôre encountering the following issues:

üß™ What we've tried:
import * as aeSdkUtils from '@aeternity/aepp-sdk': does not expose encodeBase58Check, directly or under any nested utils, Crypto, or similar object.

await import('@aeternity/aepp-sdk/es/utils/crypto.js'): throws ERR_PACKAGE_PATH_NOT_EXPORTED.

This suggests that encodeBase58Check is not accessible through standard or dynamic ESM imports in v14 due to packaging restrictions.

‚ùì Our Questions:
Is encodeBase58Check (or an equivalent for converting a Buffer ‚Üí sk_... string) available in @aeternity/aepp-sdk@14.0.0 via any supported ESM import path?

If not, which version of the SDK (e.g., 13.x) still supports this utility in a publicly accessible, ESM-compatible way?

If downgrading is the recommended path, will that break compatibility with:

MemoryAccount,

the current AeSdk constructor options,

or recent Node.js (v23.x) environments?

We‚Äôd prefer to stick with v14 if possible, but are open to downgrading if there‚Äôs no supported way to access encodeBase58Check.

Thanks again for your guidance ‚Äî your help has already been invaluable in resolving earlier blockers.

This message gives the expert everything they need to provide a clear answer. Let me know if you'd like to simultaneously prepare a fallback module that replicates encodeBase58Check using internal SDK code (based on open source) in case no exportable path is provided.

# Elizaos expert 

Your assessment and draft are spot-on. Here's my expert review and slight refinement for technical clarity and precision:

‚úÖ Summary of What You Got Right:
The ERR_PACKAGE_PATH_NOT_EXPORTED confirms Node‚Äôs strict ESM export resolution is blocking access to internal paths like es/utils/crypto.js ‚Äî this is expected unless explicitly exposed via "exports" in package.json.

@aeternity/aepp-sdk@14.0.0 does not expose encodeBase58Check via either the default export or the @aeternity/aepp-sdk/utils/crypto internal structure.

Your proposal to ask about a downgrade is valid ‚Äî SDK v13 or earlier may have had looser module resolution or better top-level exports.

Your question for the SDK experts is well-framed, gives context, explains what you've tried, and asks precisely what you need.

‚úÖ Refined Version of the Expert Question (optional for better clarity):
We are using @aeternity/aepp-sdk@14.0.0 in an ESM context (Node.js 23, dynamic plugin via ElizaOS) and need to convert a raw private key buffer into the sk_... format required by MemoryAccount. This requires the encodeBase58Check function, previously available via the SDK‚Äôs crypto utilities.

However:

import * as aeSdkUtils from '@aeternity/aepp-sdk' does not expose encodeBase58Check at any level we can access (top-level, utils, crypto, etc).

Attempting await import('@aeternity/aepp-sdk/es/utils/crypto.js') fails with ERR_PACKAGE_PATH_NOT_EXPORTED, as expected under strict ESM boundaries.

üß© Questions:

Is encodeBase58Check accessible at all in v14 using ESM imports? If yes, under what path or export?

If not accessible in v14, what‚Äôs the latest version where it was accessible, and do you recommend that version for projects using MemoryAccount, AeSdk, and ElizaOS‚Äôs async ESM plugin loader?

Is there an alternative recommended utility or approach in v14+ to encode private keys to sk_... strings?

If you prefer to avoid any downgrades or delays, another plan B is to extract the raw implementation of encodeBase58Check from the source code (Base58 + checksum logic) and include it manually in your plugin ‚Äî it‚Äôs not particularly complex, though you‚Äôll need to ensure compatibility with √¶ternity‚Äôs checksum format.

Would you like a drop-in ESM-compatible version of encodeBase58Check as a fallback?

have you answerd the agent questions om my previous message i do not see any answer 


ChatGPT said:
You're right ‚Äî I haven't yet directly answered your earlier agent questions about @aeternity/hd-wallet and mnemonicToWalletKey. Let's do that now, based on your detailed context and findings.

‚úÖ Agent Question:
‚ÄúDoes mnemonicToWalletKey exist in @aeternity/hd-wallet@0.2.0?‚Äù

üü° Answer:
No ‚Äî based on your grep search of the installed files, mnemonicToWalletKey does not exist in version 0.2.0. It is not defined or exported in any .js file. That function name likely refers to an old, renamed, or incorrectly assumed utility.

‚úÖ Agent Question:
‚ÄúIf not, what is the correct function to use in @aeternity/hd-wallet@0.2.0?‚Äù

üü¢ Answer:
In @aeternity/hd-wallet@0.2.0, the primary exports are:

generateHDWallet(mnemonic, options) ‚Äì¬†generates an HD wallet instance

getHDWalletAccounts(wallet, count) ‚Äì returns multiple accounts from the wallet

To get a private key, you typically:

ts
Copy
Edit
const wallet = generateHDWallet(mnemonic);
const accounts = getHDWalletAccounts(wallet, 1);
const privateKey = accounts[0].privateKey;
This gives you the raw private key Buffer or hex, which you can then pass to something like MemoryAccount after converting it (e.g. using encodeBase58Check, if available).

‚úÖ Agent Question:
‚ÄúWhy do Object.keys() include default, module.exports, and AeternityClient, but only default has usable functions?‚Äù

üü° Answer:
That‚Äôs expected behavior when a CJS module is imported into ESM using import(). The module‚Äôs default property wraps what would be module.exports in CJS. The duplicate module.exports key is a quirk, and AeternityClient being undefined suggests it's a re-export stub or was removed but not cleaned up in the build.

‚úÖ Agent Question:
‚ÄúCould the dynamic plugin loader (ElizaOS) or ts-node/esm be interfering with resolution?‚Äù

üîµ Answer:
No direct interference, but strict ESM rules in Node v23 and the way ts-node/esm handles dynamic imports expose only exported members per the "exports" field in the target‚Äôs package.json. If a CJS module does not correctly expose internals or relies on legacy patterns, you won‚Äôt be able to access deep utilities unless the package supports dual exports (ESM + CJS).

‚úÖ TL;DR Fix Plan:
‚úÖ Use generateHDWallet and getHDWalletAccounts to obtain a private key.

üîÅ You will need encodeBase58Check to convert that private key for use with MemoryAccount. If it's not accessible in aepp-sdk@14, we can reimplement it.

Would you like a verified drop-in replacement for encodeBase58Check so you can unblock this without waiting on SDK support?
