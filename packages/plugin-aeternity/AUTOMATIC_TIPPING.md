# Aeternity Automatic Tipping System

The ængel agent now includes an automatic tipping system that rewards valuable contributions in Telegram conversations using Aeternity (AE) tokens.

## How It Works for Users

### Getting Tipped

When you make a valuable contribution in a Telegram chat with ængel:

1. If ængel responds to your message, it values your contribution
2. You'll automatically receive an AE tip for your contribution

4. Once you register your address sending a dm to the agent upon its response on the telgram group requesting it , all your tips will be sent there

### Receiving Your First Tip

When you receive your first tip:

1. ængel will send you a DM asking for your Aeternity wallet address
2. In the group chat, you'll see a notification asking you to check your DMs
3. Reply to the DM with your Aeternity address (must start with `ak_`)
4. Your address will be registered and your tip(s) will be sent
5. For all future tips, you'll receive them automatically

### What Makes a Valuable Contribution?

The system evaluates contributions based on:

- Relevance to the topic
- Depth of insight
- Helpfulness to the community
- Technical accuracy
- Uniqueness of perspective

### Tip Amounts

Tip amounts vary based on the perceived value of your contribution:

- Minor contributions: 0.1 AE
- Helpful contributions: 0.5 AE
- Valuable contributions: 1.0 AE
- Major contributions: 2.0 AE
- Exceptional contributions: 5.0 AE
